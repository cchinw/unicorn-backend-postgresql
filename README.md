## Background

Grief is hard. It is isolating and it can feel like nobody understands, and nobody can get what it is that you're feeling. Different people grieve in different ways, and while some seek for external help, many people, for many reasons, don't.
I know I felt that way when I lost my best friend of 11 years. I completely shut down and stopped talking to everyone, including those close to me. I didn't like to be around people because I felt like I was putting my "sad energy" on them, so I kept to myself a lot.
But in that same period, I now realize how lucky I was to have my tribe. We were a clique of best friends who all lost our best friend, so it was easy to talk to them about anything and everything. I started to see things a lot more differently. I also started to realize how much comfort that came from the words of people who have dealt with and are still dealing with loss. I found a new community, and because of them, I was able to cope.
The goal of this app is to build an anonymous tribe. A community of familiar strangers to help each other get through the darkest times of their lives. To build a community where people are able to share without any judgement or feelings of discomfort, and to find resources, support groups, grief counselling and therapy closest to them if they ever choose to get help.

## Getting Started

Once the website loads, a user can register an account with a unique username and email address, or connect their social sites.
Once they are logged in, they have access to their profile page where they can fill out what their intent is, tell the story of who they lost, let the community know what their intention for joiningg the app is, and choose the grief stage they're on so people know how to help them.
They can choose to navigate the app based on their relationship to the person they've lost, or just choose to explore the different topics of the day and share at will. They can share memories, moments, pictures etc of their loved ones, if they so choose. They can also explore articles and other resources on dealing with grief and loss.
